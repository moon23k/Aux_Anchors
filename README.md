## SumNMT
This repo covers a series of codes to deal with Text Summarization and Neural Machine Translation at once.
Maybe the most simple way to make complexed model is to join Two Independent Models. But the main purpose in repo is to make End-to-End Model.
The most difficult matter for this is to retain Training Dataset. Unfortunately, I failed to get open-source dataset on this Task. So I decided to make my own dataset by myself.
